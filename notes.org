* Daniel Notes
** page 1
*** DONE Fermion: Matter; Boson: Interaction
*** DONE 3 interactions in SM: EW, weak + strong
*** DONE electrons interact with anything *that carries a charge*
** page 2
*** DONE +- sign
*** DONE strong force between quarks -> hadrons
**** 
** page 3
*** DONE check relativ force values
*** DONE rephrase antiparticle charge inversion (neutrino majorana/dirac?)
*** DONE equation 1.1 explain T and U as kinetic and potential energy
** page 5
*** DONE refer or define gell man matrices 
*** DONE SU(3) dimension is 8 -> 8 interactions
*** DONE gluons massless because it is an exact symmetry
*** DONE gluons are bi-colour objects 
*** DONE write red green blue explicitly
*** DONE neutrally coloured
*** DONE lagrangian density
** page 6
*** TODO lagrangian density
*** TODO yang-mills?
*** DONE introduce field B_\mu first and then give eigenstates W+-
*** DONE capitalize NATURE
*** glashow, salam, weinberg references
*** DONE always write W boson and Z boson
*** DONE equation 1.16 lambda^1 !! and change H to \phi
** page 7
*** quote all 3 authors, and give CMS paper reference
*** TODO lagrangian density; use H for higgs field
*** show mass term with H dublet
*** explain how masses are generated
*** 1 higgs dublet -> 4 dof -> W+-, Z and finally higgs
*** same for susy model
*** 2 higgs dublets -> 3 gauge bosons -> 5 higgs
*** give all higgs couplings, stronger argument for SM higgs
** page 8 
*** DONE complete the energy content 25% DM, 70% DE (ref. planck measurement)
** page 9
*** DONE massive and slower -> cold dark matter
** page 10
*** DONE equation 1.20 term in (...) corresponds to masses between scalar and fermion -> only holds true for TeV SUSY
*** DONE light higgs is bad; higgs mass = z mass + stop mass correction
*** DONE 10^16 GeV
*** DONE the INVARIANCE of a translation in time ... (Nöther's theorem)
** page 11
*** TODO mssm is a particular case of susy
*** DONE only two dublets added
** page 12
*** equation 1.27 explain 5 higgs bosons with 2 higgs dublets -> 8 dof
*** DONE susy particle masses are outside?? of reach of current exp
** page 13
*** DONE mention other models; Gauge mediated GMSB; other ways to realize SUSY
** page 14
