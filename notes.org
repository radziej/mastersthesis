* *Master's Thesis TODO List*
** DONE check tt+V statement not to include tt+gamma
** DONE check smearing to be 1/pt
** DONE stat error from MC
** DONE muon system graphic
** DONE Fix number of events and weights in dataset tables
** DONE explain values after last bin 
** DONE exactly 2 muons in muon sel
** DONE summary of MC titles
** DONE fix DY contribution in final dist
** DONE k-Faktor graphic and xs scaling to old limits
** DONE add citations for theorists tool and andreas/lars
** DONE check generator information Xs
** DONE fix datadbg subtraction
** DONE variate sigma_MC for jer
** DONE change single bin counting exp
** DONE add poisson error to prediction
** DONE take conservative values (incl xs)
** DONE change 2012A to doublemu
** DONE add signal uncertainties
   - 5% PDF, 5% Scale, 7% SUSY-QCD at NLO
** DONE ask daniel about how trigg eff has been determined
** DONE update systematics
   - other values
   - closure test
   - summary
** DONE generate d_0 < 0.08 distribution
** DONE add MET distribution for T/L ratio in datadbg
** DONE jjmm_m plot to show 6 bins -> maybe show a signal which is located in another bin to show multibin efficiency gain
   also add summary table for jjmm_m
** DONE trigg efficiency distribution in syst
** DONE show signal distributions
** DONE outlook
   - adjust cuts to point in phase space
   - simplified models
** DONE final distribution -> final state?
** DONE fix ratio plots having small x axis title
** DONE change text of closure proof to use control region
** DONE smoothing only in 2d T/L histogram
** DONE fixed signal region numbering
** TODO explain smoothing in F_R?
